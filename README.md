# Algorithms-and-data

The code taken from my Algorithms and data module at The University of Huddersfield.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this module I have been taught about many different useful methods and algorithms for java programming. The subjects can be seen bellow:

- Random shuffle algorithms.
- Testing of code.
- Generics.
- Searching and sorting algorithms.
- Singly linked lists.
- Binary Trees.
- Hashtables.
- Graphs.
- Topological Sorts.
- Concurrent System.
- Dekkers Algorithm.
- Semaphores.
- Monitors.
- Quantum computing.
